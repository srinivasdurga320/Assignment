# File Upload Application

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a file upload application consisting of both client-side and server-side components. The application allows users to upload files from the client interface, which are then processed by the server.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm for running the client application.
- Python 3.x for running the server application.

## Client Setup

1. **Navigate to Client Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Upload File:**
   - Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:3000).
   - Navigate to the upload feature within the client application.
   - Follow the prompts to select and upload a file.

## Server Setup

1. **Navigate to Server Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set Django Settings Module:**
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=server.settings
   ```

6. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Run Django Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Uploading a File:
1. **Client Side:**
   - After starting the client application, navigate to the file upload feature.
   - Click on the file upload button to select a file from your local system.
   - Follow any on-screen instructions to complete the upload process.

2. **Server Side:**
   - Once the client has uploaded the file, the server application will receive the file data.
   - The server will process the uploaded file as per the defined logic (not specified in the provided documentation).
   - Any relevant output or response will be generated by the server application, depending on its functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure that both the client and server applications are running simultaneously to facilitate file upload and processing.
- If there are specific endpoints or functionalities within the server application related to file upload, provide additional details or documentation for users to interact with them effectively.
